```

## The data

```{r load-data, warning=FALSE}
#### Script for exploring KI-cat trapping data ###
setwd("..")
suppressWarnings(source("src/load-data.R"))
```

The data report trap nights on the Dudley peninsula.  I am assuming there is a row for every open trap night.

Under this assumption, we can get at catch per unit effort simply through summarising the data, like so.

```{r cpue, warning=FALSE}
library(lubridate)

# get catch per unit effort
cpue <- d %>% mutate(day = day(date), month = month(date), year = year(date)) %>%
  mutate(cat = species == "Cat") %>%
  group_by(year, month) %>%
  summarise(effort = n(), catch = sum(cat, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  mutate(cpue = catch/effort) %>%
  arrange(year, month) %>%
  mutate(date = ymd(paste(year, month, "01", sep = "-")))
```

Let's just check a few things.  First, does effort look correct, across time?

```{r effort-time}
plot(effort~date, data = cpue, type = "b")
```
Looks like a massive increase in effort July - Sep 2023, followed by effort dropping to 1 trap in all of October.  Is that correct?

We can also plot cpue against time.

```{r cpue-time}
plot(cpue~date, data = cpue, type = "b")
```

Which is rather dominated by the one cat that was caught with one trap in October 2023.  If we remove that one...

```{r cpue-time-subset}
ss <- cpue$cpue != 1
plot(cpue~date, data = cpue[ss,], type = "b")
```
Which is interesting.  Some nice patterns in there.  Looks to be some seasonal effects and form mid-2021 a stead decrease in cpue.  But then a surprising increase in 2024, when trap effort was at an historic low.  What's going on there?  Are we flooded with cats, have the traps become wildly effective?  Is there some change in how the data are recorded?

## Space

I also thought it might be nice to see trap effort and return through space over time.  First step was to casst the dataframe to a spatial object.  Where I discovered 1403 missing lat/longs.  I assume coordinates are using the WGS84 ellipsoid.

Note also there are a couple of typos in the latitudes: two points which have latitudes greater than -35.7 (so are not on KI).

Anyway... here's what the trap effort looks like over time.

```{r trap-gif}
knitr::include_graphics("../out/dynamic-map/traps-over-time.gif")
```

Which kinda makes interpreting the cpue data a little more complicated than I first thought :-)

Anyway, this is a first run through.  A couple of issues flagged:
 - do the the effort and catch data look correct?
 - can we get the missing 1403 coordinates?
 - can we get the correct coordinates for the two traps with latitude typos
