## The data

```{r load-data, warning=FALSE}
#### Script for exploring KI-cat trapping data ###
setwd("..")
suppressWarnings(source("src/load-data.R"))
```

The data report trap nights on the Dudley peninsula.  I am assuming there is a row for every open trap night.

Under this assumption, we can get at catch per unit effort simply through summarising the data, like so.

```{r cpue, warning=FALSE}
# get catch per unit effort
cpue <- d %>% mutate(day = day(date), month = month(date), year = year(date)) %>%
  mutate(cat = species == "Cat") %>%
  group_by(year, month) %>%
  summarise(effort = n(), catch = sum(cat, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  mutate(cpue = catch/effort) %>%
  arrange(year, month) %>%
  mutate(date = ymd(paste(year, month, "01", sep = "-")))
```

Let's just check a few things.  First, does effort look correct, across time?

```{r effort-time}
plot(effort~date, data = cpue, type = "b")
```

We can also plot cpue against time.

```{r cpue-time}
plot(cpue~date, data = cpue, type = "b")
```

Which is rather dominated by the one cat that was caught with one trap in October 2023.  If we remove that one...

```{r cpue-time-subset}
ss <- cpue$cpue != 1
plot(cpue~date, data = cpue[ss,], type = "b")
```
Which is interesting.  Some nice patterns in there.  Looks to be some seasonal effects and from mid-2021 a steady decrease in cpue.  But then a surprising increase in 2024, when trap effort was at an historic low.  What's going on there?  There is a change in how the data are recorded with a switch to celium traps.

## Space

I also thought it might be nice to see trap effort and return through space over time.  First step was to casst the dataframe to a spatial object.  Where I discovered 1403 missing lat/longs.  I assume coordinates are using the WGS84 ellipsoid.

Note also there are a couple of typos in the latitudes: two points which have latitudes greater than -35.7 (so are not on KI).

Anyway... here's what the trap effort looks like over time.

```{r trap-gif}
knitr::include_graphics("../out/dynamic-map/traps-over-time.gif")
```

Which kinda makes interpreting the cpue data a little more complicated than I first thought :-)

Anyway, this is a first run through.  A couple of issues flagged:
 - do the the effort and catch data look correct?
 - can we get the missing 1403 coordinates?
 - can we get the correct coordinates for the two traps with latitude typos
